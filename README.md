#### This supplement provides SNDlib instances(http://sndlib.zib.de) with multiple scenarios generated for comparison between the proposed Benders decomposition algorithm and CPLEX. Random demands in the range [*0.7d<sub>k</sub>, 1.3d<sub>k</sub>*], where *d<sub>k</sub>* is the given demand for commodity *k*. All instances are given in `.mps` format.

#### Instances are contained in a folder in which the number of random scenarios is the name. For example, folder `sndlib_sp/10` contains instances with ten random scenarios.
